# OpenFaaS Function Development

## Pre-flight checks

Before generating any function code, verify the toolchain is available and configured.

1. Check `faas-cli` is installed: `faas-cli version`. If missing, install with `arkade get faas-cli` or `curl -sSL https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh`.
2. Inspect the output of `faas-cli version` for the gateway's orchestration provider. If it reports a Kubernetes server version, the cluster is Kubernetes-backed and `kubectl` is available as a break-glass option (see [Use kubectl only as a break glass](#use-kubectl-only-as-a-break-glass)).
3. Confirm Docker is running: `docker info`.
4. If deploying to a cluster, expect `OPENFAAS_URL` and `OPENFAAS_PREFIX` to be set (the latter is the image registry prefix used by `faas-cli new`, e.g. `ghcr.io/acme` or `ttl.sh/<user>`).

## Core workflow

The standard inner loop is:

```bash
faas-cli new --lang <template> <fn-name>     # scaffold
# edit ./<fn-name>/handler.<ext>
faas-cli local-run --build <fn-name>          # build + run locally (BLOCKING — background it / tmux; see below)
# OR full cycle:
faas-cli diff -f <fn-name>.yml                # preview changes vs the cluster (before deploying)
faas-cli up -f <fn-name>.yml                  # build + push + deploy
```

Prefer `faas-cli local-run --build` for local iteration. It builds the image and runs it in a single command, so a separate `faas-cli build` step is unnecessary. Only run `faas-cli build` on its own when you specifically need the image without running it (e.g. to push, inspect, or hand to another tool).

See [Testing with `local-run`](#testing-with-local-run) below for the local loop and [Iterating fast](#iterating-fast) for live-reload options.

## Testing with `local-run`

`faas-cli local-run --build` builds the function and starts it as a Docker container that listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in a single step — there is no need to run `faas-cli build` first. Without `--build`, `local-run` will only run an existing image.

Two flags matter here:

- `--build` — build the image first, then run it (omit only if the image already exists).
- `--watch` — rebuild + restart automatically when the handler changes (live-reload loop). `--watch` is **also a blocking foreground process** — it runs until you stop it, so it needs the same background/tmux treatment as plain `local-run`.

**`local-run` is a blocking, foreground process that never returns on its own** — it runs until you stop it (Ctrl+C) or kill the process. If you run it as a plain foreground command from an agent's shell or a non-interactive tool (an `opencode`/`claude` bash tool, a CI step, a script), **that call hangs forever** waiting on a process that will not exit. This is the most common way an agent gets stuck mid-task on this skill. Never run `local-run` in the foreground from an automation context.

Two safe ways to run it:

**A. Background it and poll for readiness (preferred for agents).** Redirect to a log, background it, poll a bounded number of seconds for the ready line, invoke, then kill it:

```bash
faas-cli local-run --build my-fn > /tmp/local-run.log 2>&1 &
LR=$!
for i in $(seq 1 90); do
  grep -q "Listening on port" /tmp/local-run.log && break
  sleep 1
done
curl -s -i http://127.0.0.1:8080 -d "hello"
kill "$LR" 2>/dev/null
```

**B. Run it in its own tmux pane/session** (for a human, or an agent that owns a tmux session):

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s fn 'faas-cli local-run --build my-fn'
# wait for the ready line, e.g.: tmux capture-pane -t fn -p | grep 'Listening on port'
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080 -d "hello"
tmux kill-session -t fn
```

If port 8080 is already in use, override it with `--port` (e.g. `--port 8085`) and curl that port instead.

> **For a cluster deploy you usually do not need `local-run` at all.** It is the local iteration loop. If the task is "deploy to the cluster and prove it works," go straight to `faas-cli up` / `faas-cli deploy` and invoke the deployed function — skipping `local-run` sidesteps the blocking-process trap entirely.

If `stack.yaml` has multiple functions, pass the function name as an argument: `faas-cli local-run --build <fn-name>`.

### Port conflicts and reaching host services

`local-run` binds the function to `:8080` by default. If the host already runs
something there (another `local-run`, a dev server), pick a free port with
`--port`:

```bash
faas-cli local-run my-fn --port 8085
```

With `--network host` the `--port` flag is **ignored** — the of-watchdog reads
its port from the `port` env var instead:

```bash
faas-cli local-run my-fn --network host -e port=8085
```

A bridged `local-run` container (the default, without `--network host`) does
**not** reach host services on `127.0.0.1` — inside the container that address
is the container itself. To reach a database, a `slicer vm forward`, or any
other host-side service, use the Docker bridge gateway `172.17.0.1`, and make
sure the service (or forward) listens on that interface or `0.0.0.0`:

```bash
# host: e.g. a Postgres forwarded from a VM, bound so the bridge can see it
slicer vm forward pg-vm -L 172.17.0.1:5432:127.0.0.1:5432 &

# function: point it at the gateway, not 127.0.0.1
faas-cli local-run my-fn --port 8085 -e postgres_host=172.17.0.1
```

### Iterate against a fake sink, not real endpoints

When a function posts to an outbound webhook (Discord, Slack, a partner API),
point its webhook secret at a local **sink** during iteration so you inspect the
exact payloads instead of firing at the real channel. A few lines of Python is
enough:

```python
# sink.py — logs each POST body, returns 204
import http.server
class H(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        n = int(self.headers.get("Content-Length", 0))
        print(self.rfile.read(n).decode("utf-8", "replace"), flush=True)
        self.send_response(204); self.end_headers()
    def log_message(self, *a): pass
http.server.HTTPServer(("0.0.0.0", 9099), H).serve_forever()
```

```bash
python3 sink.py &
# bridged local-run reaches the sink via the bridge gateway
echo "http://172.17.0.1:9099/hook" > .secrets/my-webhook-url
faas-cli local-run my-fn --port 8085
```

Swap the secret back to the real webhook only when deploying.

## Choosing a template

List available templates: `faas-cli template store list`. Recommended defaults:

| Language | Template | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `python3-http` | Flask-based HTTP. Default. |
| Python (native deps) | `python3-http-debian` | Debian base, supports `build_options` like `libpq`. |
| Node.js | `node24` | Express-based, async/await handler. |
| Go | `golang-middleware` | Uses `http.HandleFunc` from stdlib, supports modules and vendoring. |

Pull a template explicitly with `faas-cli template store pull <name>` if not auto-fetched.

## Scaffolding a function

Always scaffold functions with `faas-cli new` first, then modify the generated
`stack.yaml` and the handler files inside the generated function folder. This
preserves template layout, template metadata, tests, dependency files, and
compatibility with `faas-cli build`, `local-run`, `publish`, and `deploy`.

```bash
export OPENFAAS_PREFIX=ttl.sh/<user>          # or your registry prefix
faas-cli new --lang python3-http hello-python
```

This creates:
- `hello-python/handler.py` (or `.js`, `.go`, etc.) — your code
- `hello-python/requirements.txt` (or `package.json`, `go.mod`) — dependencies
- `hello-python.yml` — the stack file

To append additional functions to the same stack file, use `--append`:

```bash
faas-cli new --lang node24 echo --append hello-python.yml
```

## Microservices and existing images (no template)

Templates are the default, but an existing service — FastAPI, Express,
Sinatra, ASP.NET — can run on OpenFaaS without one. Use `lang: dockerfile`
(or `skip_build: true` for an image you cannot rebuild) and satisfy the
[workload definition](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/workloads/): serve
HTTP on port 8080, implement `/_/health` and `/_/ready`, stay stateless, shut
down gracefully on `SIGTERM`.

Two routes:

- **No watchdog** — the app serves 8080 and implements the health endpoints
  itself. **Most watchdog environment variables are silently inert on this
  route** (`read_timeout`, `exec_timeout`, `max_inflight`, `prefix_logs`):
  they are read by the watchdog process, which is not in the image, so
  timeouts and concurrency become the app server's job. `write_timeout` is
  the exception — on OpenFaaS Pro the operator also reads it off the function
  to set the Pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, so it still affects
  draining on scale-down regardless of what is in the image.
- **of-watchdog in HTTP mode** — recommended. Copy `/fwatchdog` in from
  `ghcr.io/openfaas/of-watchdog`, bind the app to `127.0.0.1:5000`, and set
  `fprocess`, `mode=http` and `upstream_url`. The watchdog owns 8080 plus
  `/_/health` and `/_/ready` (these never reach the app), and you get
  consistent timeouts, logging, graceful shutdown and `max_inflight` back.

For the full comparison, Dockerfile patterns, and the pre-built-image case,
read [reference/microservices.md](reference/microservices.md).

## Handler shapes per language

See [reference/handlers.md](reference/handlers.md) for complete handler templates and examples per language (Python, Node, Go).

Quick reference:

**Python (`python3-http`)** — return a dict with `statusCode`, `body`, optional `headers`. `event` exposes `body`, `headers`, `method`, `query`, `path`.

**Node.js (`node24`)** — `module.exports = async (event, context) => context.status(200).succeed(result)`. Async/await supported.

**Go (`golang-middleware`)** — `func Handle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)` — write to `w`, read from `r`. Always `defer r.Body.Close()` if reading.

## stack.yaml essentials

Authoritative reference: [reference/stack-yaml.md](reference/stack-yaml.md). Common fields:

```yaml
version: 1.0
provider:
  name: openfaas
  gateway: http://127.0.0.1:8080
functions:
  my-fn:
    lang: python3-http
    handler: ./my-fn
    image: ${REGISTRY:-ttl.sh/myuser}/my-fn:${TAG:-latest}
    environment:
      LOG_LEVEL: info
    secrets:
      - my-fn-token
    build_options:
      - libpq                   # named bundle from template.yml
    build_args:
      ADDITIONAL_PACKAGE: "jq"  # extra apk/apt packages
    limits:
      memory: 128Mi
      cpu: 100m
    requests:
      memory: 64Mi
      cpu: 50m
    annotations:
      topic: kafka.payments-received
configuration:
  templates:
    - name: python3-http
      source: https://github.com/openfaas/python-flask-template
```

Notes:
- `image` supports `${VAR:-default}` envsubst — keep registry overridable.
- `handler` is always a folder, never a filename.
- Function name must be a DNS label (lowercase alphanumeric and `-`, max 63 chars).
- Pin templates by appending `#tag-or-branch` to the `source` URL for reproducible builds.
- `configuration.copy` lists project sub-paths to inject into every function's handler folder (for shared `./common`, `./models`, etc.).

## Dependencies

- **Python**: list packages in `<fn>/requirements.txt`. For native libs (e.g. `psycopg2`), use `python3-http-debian` and add `build_options: [libpq]` or `build_args: { ADDITIONAL_PACKAGE: "libpq-dev gcc python3-dev" }`.
- **Node**: `cd <fn> && npm install --save <pkg>`. Tests in `<fn>/test/` run automatically during `faas-cli build`.
- **Go**: `cd <fn> && go get <module>`. For private modules, set `GOPRIVATE=...`, run `go mod vendor`, commit `vendor/`. For sub-packages, add `replace handler/function => ./` to `go.mod`.

### Never `pip install --user` in a custom Dockerfile

When writing your own Dockerfile, install Python dependencies **system-wide as
root**, then drop to the non-root user. `pip install --user` puts packages in
`$HOME/.local/...`, and OpenFaaS can be installed with
`functions.setNonRootUser=true`, which forces every function container to run
as UID `12000` and overrides the image's `USER`. UID 12000 has no
`/etc/passwd` entry, so `HOME` becomes `/` and those packages are invisible.

The function then crash-loops with `ModuleNotFoundError` **in the cluster
only** — `local-run` and `docker run` use the image's own `USER` and work
fine, so this never reproduces locally unless you ask for it:

```bash
docker run --rm --user 12000 --entrypoint python <image> -c "import <pkg>"
```

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt   # as root, system-wide
COPY --chown=app:app main.py .
USER app
```

This also applies to the official `python3-http` / `python3-http-debian`
templates, which install the function's `requirements.txt` with `--user`: a
function with no dependencies is fine, but adding one fails this way on a
cluster with `setNonRootUser` enabled.

## Secrets

Always read secrets from files, never environment variables:

1. Create the secret: `faas-cli secret create my-token --from-file my-token.txt`. Prefer `faas-cli` for routine work; only fall back to `kubectl create secret` as a break glass when `faas-cli` cannot do the job and `faas-cli version` confirms a Kubernetes server (see [Use kubectl only as a break glass](#use-kubectl-only-as-a-break-glass)).
2. Bind in `stack.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   secrets:
     - my-token
   ```
3. Read at runtime from `/var/openfaas/secrets/my-token`.

For `local-run`, place secret files in a `.secrets/` directory **at the project root, next to `stack.yaml`** — for example `./.secrets/my-token`. `faas-cli local-run` bind-mounts this top-level directory into the running container at `/var/openfaas/secrets/`.

**Never create `.secrets/` inside a function's handler folder** (e.g. `./my-fn/.secrets/`). The handler folder is copied into the image during `faas-cli build`, which would bake the secret values directly into the published container image and leak them to anyone who can pull the image. Always keep `.secrets/` outside every handler folder, and add `.secrets/` to `.gitignore` and any `.dockerignore` files.

Update with `faas-cli secret update`. Re-read the file on each invocation (or use `fsnotify`) since the kubelet rotates the mounted file.

## Build/deploy commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `faas-cli build -f stack.yml` | Build image into local Docker library (rarely needed on its own — prefer `local-run --build` for local testing or `up` for deploy) |
| `faas-cli push -f stack.yml` | Push image to registry |
| `faas-cli deploy -f stack.yml` | Deploy to cluster |
| `faas-cli up -f stack.yml` | Build + push + deploy in one step |
| `faas-cli local-run --build [name]` | Build + run as a local Docker container on `:8080` (preferred local loop; omit `--build` only if the image is already built) |
| `faas-cli publish --platforms linux/arm64,linux/amd64 --tag=digest` | Multi-arch build + push with a content-derived tag (use instead of build/push for ARM) |
| `faas-cli build --shrinkwrap` | Emit a `./build/<fn>/Dockerfile` for use with external builders |
| `faas-cli generate -f stack.yml` | Convert stack.yml to Kubernetes CRD YAML for GitOps |
| `faas-cli diff -f stack.yml` | Show how `stack.yaml` differs from what's deployed (read-only); run before deploy |
| `faas-cli list -v` / `faas-cli describe <fn>` | Inspect deployed functions, readiness, image, env, secrets, and URLs |
| `faas-cli logs <fn>` | Tail function logs |
| `echo "data" \| faas-cli invoke <fn>` | Invoke a deployed function |

After editing `stack.yaml`, run `faas-cli diff` before `deploy`/`up` to preview exactly which fields (image, env, labels, annotations, secrets) will change on the cluster. It is read-only (a single GET) and exits non-zero when differences exist, so it also works as a CI drift check. Because it compares against the live spec, it surfaces out-of-band changes — e.g. annotations or env a controller/operator patched onto the deployed function that aren't in your `stack.yaml` — so you don't silently overwrite them on the next deploy. Pass the same `--tag` you deploy with (e.g. `--tag=digest`) so the image comparison is accurate.

When you need to read a value programmatically rather than for a human, add `-j, --json` and parse with `jq` instead of scraping the formatted tables. Supported on `list`, `describe`, `version`, `logs`, `store list`, `store describe`, and `template store list` — e.g. `faas-cli describe my-fn --json | jq -r '.image'`.

Do not pass `--skip-push` when deploying to a Kubernetes cluster — the cluster pulls from a registry, so skipping the push leaves it with a missing or stale image. Only use `--skip-push` for faasd on the same host or when you have loaded the image into the cluster yourself (`kind load docker-image`, etc.).

## Always advance the image tag on deploy

**Critical:** Kubernetes will not pull a new image if the tag has not changed. Depending on the cluster's `imagePullPolicy` (commonly `IfNotPresent`), pushing a new image to the same tag — including `:latest` — can leave the old image running in the function pod. Every deploy must use a new, unique image tag.

Two ways to ensure tags advance:

1. **Let the CLI generate a unique tag** by passing `--tag` to `build`, `push`, `publish`, `deploy`, or `up`:

   | Value | Tag suffix | When to use |
   |---|---|---|
   | `--tag=digest` | content hash of the handler folder | Rebuilds and watch loops; new tag only when code actually changes. Recommended for `--watch`. |
   | `--tag=sha` | short Git commit SHA | CI/CD on a clean working tree. |
   | `--tag=branch` | branch + short SHA | Preview deploys per branch. |
   | `--tag=describe` | output of `git describe` | Release builds with annotated tags. |

   The generated value is appended to whatever tag is in `stack.yaml` (or `latest` if none). Example:

   ```bash
   faas-cli up -f stack.yml --tag=digest
   # builds and deploys image: ghcr.io/acme/my-fn:latest-abc123…
   ```

   For publish/deploy flows, use the same tag strategy for both steps:

   ```bash
   faas-cli publish -f stack.yml --filter my-fn --platforms linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --tag=digest
   faas-cli deploy -f stack.yml --filter my-fn --tag=digest
   ```

2. **Bump the tag manually in `stack.yaml`** using `envsubst`:

   ```yaml
   image: ghcr.io/acme/my-fn:${TAG:-0.1.0}
   ```

   ```bash
   TAG=0.1.1 faas-cli up
   ```

Avoid relying on `:latest` for cluster deploys. Reserve `:latest` for `local-run` only. Prefer `--tag=digest` for local iteration, rebuilds, `publish`, deploys, and watch loops. Use `--tag=sha` mainly for CI/CD from a real Git checkout. The `--tag` flag combines with environment-variable substitution, so a CI pipeline can set a base version in `stack.yaml` and append `--tag=sha` for traceability.

## Function URLs and readiness

After deploying, run:

```bash
faas-cli describe <fn>
```

Use `describe` to confirm the function is `Ready` before treating it as available for invocations. It also shows the deployed image, environment, bound secrets, usage, and the full sync and async URLs.

The conventional gateway paths are:

```text
/function/<fn>        # synchronous invocation
/async-function/<fn>  # asynchronous invocation
```

## Iterating fast

- Use `faas-cli local-run --watch` for the tightest loop on a single function (no cluster needed). Like `local-run`, `--watch` is a blocking foreground process — run it in a tmux pane or backgrounded, never as a plain foreground command from an agent's shell.
- Use `faas-cli up --watch --tag=digest` when functions need cluster services (other functions, gateway). The `--tag=digest` is required here so each save produces a unique tag the cluster will actually pull.
- Use `ttl.sh/<user>` as registry for throwaway images during prototyping. **Warning: ttl.sh is a public, anonymous registry** — anyone who guesses the image path can pull it. Never use it for proprietary or customer code, secrets baked into images, or anything you would not publish openly. For private workloads use a private registry (GHCR private, ECR, GCR, Docker Hub private repo, Harbor, etc.) and run `faas-cli registry-login` to authenticate.

## Readiness checks for initialization

If the handler does any work before it can serve requests — loading an ML
model, warming a cache, downloading data, opening a DB / SDK client —
**add a custom readiness check**. Without one, the first request after
scale-from-zero (or after a new Pod starts) hits a Pod that is up but not
yet able to handle work, returning 500 / timeout.

Two pieces:

1. Handler exposes a path (conventionally `/ready`) that returns **200**
   when init has finished and **500** while it is still running. Run init
   off the request path (Python module load or `threading.Thread`, Node
   top-level async IIFE, Go `init()` + goroutine setting an
   `atomic.Value`).
2. `stack.yaml` points OpenFaaS at that path. **The
   `com.openfaas.ready.http.*` annotations are an OpenFaaS Pro feature** — on
   CE they are ignored and both probes use `/_/health`, so the custom check
   silently has no effect:

   ```yaml
   functions:
     my-fn:
       annotations:
         com.openfaas.ready.http.path: /ready
         com.openfaas.ready.http.initialDelaySeconds: 2
         com.openfaas.ready.http.periodSeconds: 2
   ```

For long warm-ups (large model load, big cache), raise
`initialDelaySeconds` so the first probe fires after init is expected to
complete (e.g. `60` for a 60-second load) rather than probing on a tight
loop.

Liveness (`com.openfaas.health.http.*`) is separate and rarely needed —
the watchdog ships a built-in liveness probe. Use readiness for "alive
but not yet able to take traffic"; use a custom liveness only when the
process should actually be killed and restarted on some condition.

For per-language handler patterns (Python / Node / Go), the full
annotation list, and the `max_inflight` + `/_/ready` + `ready_path`
watchdog combinator for hard concurrency limits, read
[reference/health-readiness.md](reference/health-readiness.md).

## Triggers and scheduling

Functions are invoked over HTTP by default. To run them on a schedule or from an external event-source, use an official OpenFaaS **event-connector** (Cron, Kafka, Postgres, SQS, SNS, Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ) by adding a `topic:` annotation in `stack.yaml`. Do not build polling or subscription SDKs into the handler.

**For scheduled / cron-style invocations, use the OpenFaaS cron-connector — never a Kubernetes `CronJob`.** The cron-connector is portable across all providers (Kubernetes CE/Pro, OpenFaaS Edge/faasd). When the user needs a schedule, read [reference/cron-schedule.md](reference/cron-schedule.md) for the annotation pattern and rules.

For the full list of available triggers and the generic connector wiring pattern, read [reference/triggers.md](reference/triggers.md).

## Helper functions from the store

The OpenFaaS function store ships small pre-built functions that are
useful while developing, testing, and debugging your own functions. Deploy
them on demand with `faas-cli store deploy <name>` (`faas-cli store list`
to browse). They live in the cluster, so they share the function's
network and DNS context.

Common picks:

- `printer` — pretty-prints incoming requests (headers + body) into its
  logs. Use as a chained target or async `X-Callback-Url`, then
  `faas-cli logs printer -t` to inspect what arrived.
- `chaos` — returns canned status codes / delays / bodies via `/set`.
  Drive error paths, retry / timeout handling without touching your code.
- `env` — dumps the function's env vars; verify `environment:` and
  watchdog config were applied.
- `sleep` — sleeps a configurable duration; reproduce timeouts.
- `curl` / `nslookup` — debug in-cluster connectivity and DNS from a
  function's network context.

Remove these when you're done — do not leave debug helpers running in
production. For full patterns and examples, read
[reference/store-helpers.md](reference/store-helpers.md).

## Use kubectl only as a break glass

Drive function development, deployment, and inspection through `faas-cli`. Do not reach for `kubectl` for routine tasks like deploying, listing, invoking, scaling, fetching logs, or managing secrets — `faas-cli` covers these consistently across providers (Kubernetes, faasd, etc.).

Only use `kubectl` when **both** of these are true:

1. `faas-cli version` reports a Kubernetes server (the gateway is running on Kubernetes). On non-Kubernetes providers like faasd, `kubectl` is not applicable — do not use it.
2. The task is a genuine break-glass or deeper-debugging scenario that `faas-cli` cannot handle, for example:
   - Inspecting pod-level state: `kubectl -n openfaas-fn describe pod <fn>-<hash>`, `kubectl -n openfaas-fn get events`.
   - Diagnosing image pull, scheduling, or CrashLoopBackOff issues that `faas-cli logs` and `faas-cli describe` cannot explain.
   - Examining the OpenFaaS control plane in `openfaas` namespace (gateway, queue-worker, operator).
   - Checking node, RBAC, NetworkPolicy, or admission-controller behaviour interfering with a function.

When you do use `kubectl`, prefer read-only commands (`get`, `describe`, `logs`, `events`). Avoid mutating function resources (`apply`, `edit`, `delete`, `patch`) — make those changes through `stack.yaml` and `faas-cli` so the source of truth stays consistent. Note your reason for breaking glass in the response so the user understands why `faas-cli` was insufficient.

## Troubleshooting

When a function misbehaves, start with `faas-cli` and only fall back to
`kubectl` per [Use kubectl only as a break glass](#use-kubectl-only-as-a-break-glass):

```bash
faas-cli list -v                   # replicas, image, invocations
faas-cli describe <fn>              # current image/env/secrets/status
faas-cli diff                       # how deployed config drifted from stack.yaml
faas-cli logs <fn> --lines 200 --tail=false   # recent logs, then exit (see gateway note)
echo "ping" | faas-cli invoke <fn>  # exercise end-to-end
```

Add `--json` to `list`, `describe`, or `logs` when you need to parse the result with `jq` rather than read it.

**Up to and including faas-cli 0.18.11, `faas-cli logs` does not read
`provider.gateway` from `stack.yaml`.** Unlike `list`, `describe`, `deploy`
and `up`, it falls back to the default `http://127.0.0.1:8080` — even when
passed `-f stack.yaml` — and then fails against the wrong gateway's
credentials with:

```
unauthorized access, run "faas-cli login" to setup authentication for this server
```

That message looks like an expired token or a missing IAM scope, but it is a
gateway mix-up. Pass the gateway explicitly whenever the target is not
localhost, and do not conclude the token lacks permissions until you have:

```bash
faas-cli logs <fn> -g https://gateway.example.com --lines 200 --tail=false
# or
export OPENFAAS_URL=https://gateway.example.com
```

The same applies to `faas-cli remove <fn>` when invoked with a function name
rather than `-f stack.yaml`.

**Scope: function configuration only.** This skill is for diagnosing and
changing **functions** — `stack.yaml`, handler code, function env/secrets,
function-level timeouts. Some fixes below require changing the OpenFaaS
**platform** itself (gateway, queue-worker, operator, NATS, Prometheus,
Helm values, ingress / LB). **Do not patch, edit, or `helm upgrade`
OpenFaaS components.** Surface the suspected platform-level change to the
user — what component, what setting, why — and let them apply it (or
involve their cluster operator).

For deeper, shareable cluster-wide diagnostics use the `diag` plugin.
`faas-cli diag` is a break-glass tool at the same level as `kubectl` — it
talks directly to the Kubernetes API (pods, events, Function CRs,
Prometheus, stern-style logs) and needs a kubeconfig with access to the
`openfaas` namespace and any function namespaces. Reach for it only when the
first-line `faas-cli` commands above are not enough:

```bash
faas-cli plugin get diag
faas-cli diag config simple
faas-cli diag -d 5m diag.yaml       # produces ./run/<date>/index.html + tar.gz
```

Common function-level symptoms and the first thing to check:

| Symptom | First check |
|---|---|
| Code change not visible after deploy | Image tag did not advance — redeploy with `faas-cli up --tag=digest`. See [Always advance the image tag on deploy](#always-advance-the-image-tag-on-deploy). |
| `0/1` pods, `ImagePullBackOff`, `CrashLoopBackOff` | `faas-cli logs <fn>`; if empty, break-glass `kubectl describe -n openfaas-fn deploy/<fn>` and `kubectl get events -n openfaas-fn`. Usual causes: missing secret, private registry without pull secret, handler crash on boot, OOMKilled. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` in the cluster, but the function runs fine under `local-run` | Dependencies were installed with `pip install --user`, and `functions.setNonRootUser=true` overrode the image's `USER` with UID 12000. Install system-wide as root instead — see [Never `pip install --user`](#never-pip-install---user-in-a-custom-dockerfile). |
| `faas-cli logs` says `unauthorized` while `list`/`describe`/`up` work | On faas-cli 0.18.11 and earlier this is not an auth problem: `logs` ignores `provider.gateway` in `stack.yaml` and defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Pass `-g <gateway>` or set `OPENFAAS_URL`. Same applies to `faas-cli remove <fn>` when given a name rather than `-f`. |
| Function CR stuck in `stalled` status | Fix the `.Spec` issue (missing secret, bad limits) and let the operator reconcile, or force a retry by bumping `com.openfaas.uid` annotation on the Function CR. |
| Function name rejected | CRD limits names to 63 chars — shorten and use a `namespace:`. |
| Timeouts | Check function logs first; then verify function-level `read_timeout`/`write_timeout`/`exec_timeout` in `stack.yaml`. Gateway timeouts and cloud LB idle timeouts may also need bumping — flag these to the user; do not patch them yourself. Use `http://gateway.openfaas:8080` for in-cluster calls. |
| Empty / nil request body in handler | Caller missing `Content-Type` header. For legacy/WSGI upstreams set `http_buffer_req_body: true`. |
| Slow start-up flapping readiness, or 500s on first request after scale-from-zero | Add a custom `/ready` endpoint in the handler and wire it via the `com.openfaas.ready.http.path` annotation; bump `com.openfaas.ready.http.initialDelaySeconds` for long warm-ups. See [Readiness checks for initialization](#readiness-checks-for-initialization). |
| Want to test without deploying | `faas-cli local-run --build <fn>` (preferred) or `faas-cli build` + `docker run -v $(pwd)/.secrets:/var/openfaas/secrets ...`. |
| JSON / structured logs are wrapped in a prefix | Set `prefix_logs: false` on the function. |
| `local-run` exits with `invalid argument "256Mi" for "--memory-reservation" flag: invalid suffix: 'mi'` | Up to and including faas-cli 0.18.11, `local-run` passes `limits.memory` straight to `docker run --memory-reservation`, which rejects Kubernetes unit suffixes, and `limits.cpu` to `--cpus`, which rejects millicores. There is no flag to skip it — comment out `limits` while iterating locally, or upgrade. (`requests` is never passed to Docker, so it is unaffected.) |
| Watchdog env (`read_timeout`, `max_inflight`, `prefix_logs`) has no effect | The image has no watchdog in it (a `lang: dockerfile` microservice). Those variables are read by the watchdog process. See [Microservices and existing images](#microservices-and-existing-images-no-template). |

## Verification checklist

After scaffolding/editing:
1. `faas-cli local-run --build <fn>` starts (this also covers the build step); `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080` returns expected response. **Run `local-run` backgrounded or in a tmux pane** — it is a blocking foreground process and will hang a foreground/agent shell (see [Testing with `local-run`](#testing-with-local-run)). Only run `faas-cli build -f stack.yml` separately if you need the image without running it.
2. Handler returns proper status codes and `Content-Type` headers when returning JSON.
3. Secrets are read from `/var/openfaas/secrets/<name>`, not env vars. Any local `.secrets/` directory lives next to `stack.yaml`, never inside a handler folder (which would bake secrets into the image).
4. `image:` field includes a registry prefix (not bare `<fn>:latest`) before pushing.
5. When deploying to a cluster, the image tag has advanced since the previous deploy — either via `--tag=digest`/`--tag=sha` or by bumping the tag in `stack.yaml`. Never re-deploy with an unchanged tag.
6. If the handler does any pre-request initialization (model load, cache warm-up, DB pool, downloading data), a custom readiness endpoint is wired up via `com.openfaas.ready.http.path` and the handler returns 500 until init finishes. Verify by scaling to zero and invoking — the first request must succeed, not 500. See [Readiness checks for initialization](#readiness-checks-for-initialization).
